## Framework Agnostic - the best you can do for your business

On February 22, 2019, I was given a chance to present my talk on **[PHPers meetup](https://www.facebook.com/events/restauracja-venezia/phpers-opole-3/387800895303484/)** 
in Opole. I've decided to show my point of view on how to develop applications without a framework, why we should obtain 
this way while developing our systems and why it's better to be a Software Engineer instead of a "Framework Developer".

The recording from this event is available here:
