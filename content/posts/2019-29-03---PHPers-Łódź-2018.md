## GraphQL & PHP - Will it blend?

During my career as a Software Engineer at [Sylius](https://sylius.com/), we were working on a Multi-Vendor Marketplace platform. The platform was supposed to be built on top of [Sylius](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius) but the core of our new product was going to written using new techniques and technologies. One of them was [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). We decided that for Vendors Backend, we will go headless for sure. Instead of going with a standard approach like REST API, we decided that Facebook's concept of building more flexible APIs using GraphQL suits us more at that time. 

On March 28th, 2018, I made [a presentation on local PHPers Meetup](https://www.facebook.com/SyliusEcommerce/posts/1657548657655089?__cft__[0]=AZWAoJUiF7Y2rVttByC1qqzmfE8ATmnpY5XVMbXX_SDFG0PkrXvTHaHMH92BCPelpQnq_hW6kk6HQzRAAeI5H2K5cSxmH2uYKhHRL81jHSET1VEfYQrLOPIFrMKuX4EG6mQeHJ5lKuwVongoinyCg9Nqnh8gZ3VakZ0ETpRWIJATMA&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R). During my talk, I spoke about the libraries and challenges that we faced during the development of such an API in PHP.
