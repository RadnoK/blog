## Framework Agnostic - the best you can do for your business

On February 22, 2019 I was given a chance to present my talk on **[PHPers meetup](https://www.facebook.com/events/restauracja-venezia/phpers-opole-3/387800895303484/)** in Opole. I've decided to show my point of view how to develop applications without a framework, why we should obtain this way while developing our systems and why it's better than being a "framework developer". 

The recording from this event is available here:

My presentation (unfortunately it is just in Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±) starts in ~7:00 minute and ends on ~53:00 minute. **But I highly recommend to watch it fully!**

Enjoy!
