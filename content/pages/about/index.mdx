## Background

For last 6 years I've been working as a Backend Software Developer in many companies. During that time, I managed to work in software houses, start-ups, product companies or even corporations.

Almost all of my career I've been working with PHP and other supporting backend technologies like Docker, AWS or databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis.

One of the most important breakthroughs in my career was joining <a href="https://sylius.com">Sylius</a> as a Software Engineer. My responsibilities were to maintain Sylius Core and develop a new product for Marketplaces that Sylius was about to release. While working there, I understood many of eCommerce concepts and rules that were helpful when I later joined <a href="https://bitbag.io">BitBag</a> to develop eCommerce platforms using Sylius Framework and other PHP related technologies.

I used to work in or for start-ups, participating not only as a Developer but I was also involved in Business roles. As I enjoyed working not only with code but also with business side of the projects, I decided to start my own company.
