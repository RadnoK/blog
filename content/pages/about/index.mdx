## Background

For years I've been working as a Backend Software Developer. During that time, I managed to work in variety of companies: software houses, start-ups, product companies, corporations.

Most of my career I've been working with PHP and other supporting Backend technologies like Docker, AWS or databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis.

One of the most important breakthroughs in my career was joining <a href="https://sylius.com">Sylius</a> as a Software Engineer. My responsibilities were to maintain Sylius Core and develop new product for Marketplaces. In Sylius I understood many of eCommerce concepts and rules that were helpful when I joined <a href="https://bitbag.io">BitBag</a> to develop eCommerce platforms using Sylius and other PHP related technologies.

## Private

If I'm not at work I like to play with my cat and drive cars. You can follow me on <a href="https://instagram.com/radnok_">Instagram</a> to check out what I'm currently into.
